For the user's prompt:

The API is: {prompt}

We decide the generated files are: {filepaths_string}

Now that we have a file list, we need to understand the shared dependencies they have.
Please list and briefly describe the shared contents between the files we are generating, including exported variables, 
data patterns, id names of all DOM elements that javascript functions will use, message names and function names.
Focus only on the names of shared dependencies, do not add any other explanations.
