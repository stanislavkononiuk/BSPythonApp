attached are 2 things
1 . a pic of how i want the WebCrawler to look like
2. a text file of links to load



i need to add 2 things that r missing in that pic



1 is the source from where to take the links
2 is where to save all results



the idea is to load the the text attached and then get all the links that it has on those pages and save to the selected file
